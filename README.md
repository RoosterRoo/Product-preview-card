## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was having issue to get the child content and image to take equal width in desktop and discovered that
flex-basis can help fix it.

### Continued development

This is and will be a work in progress and optimizations will be done as when feedback is received

### Useful resources

- [SheCodes](https://t.ly/4eDwh) - This helped me for making the content and image take equal width in desktop mode.
